About This Project
I wanted to create a portfolio that went beyond a static page. My goal was to build a fluid, single-page application that not only presents my professional journey but also demonstrates my front-end development skills. This project was built with React and styled with pure CSS, leveraging modern techniques like CSS variables for theming and the Intersection Observer API for smooth scroll-triggered animations.

Every element, from the dark/light mode toggle to the timeline, was designed to be both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, offering a great user experience for recruiters and visitors alike.

### ✨ Key Features
🎨 **Dual-Theme Design:** A sleek dark/light mode toggle that respects user preferences and provides a comfortable viewing experience in any lighting.

💨 **Smooth Scroll Animations:** Sections gracefully fade in as you scroll, creating a dynamic and engaging journey through the content.

📱 **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first design that ensures the portfolio looks and works perfectly on all devices, from phones to desktops.

💼 **Interactive Timeline:** A clean, visual representation of my professional experience and education.

🧩 **Self-Contained Components:** Built with React to be modular and maintainable, with all styles and logic encapsulated for robustness.
